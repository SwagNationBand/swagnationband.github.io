    <h1 class="Oral" >Welcome to the official Swag Nation website!</h1>
    <h2 class="Oral" >Swag Nation, a brief history</h2>
    <p class="Para" >Swag Nation was formed when Erin Blue and former drummer Johnny met up for a jam sesh. They recorded (and released) their first demo "Sloppy" that same day. Realising the urgent need for a bass player, Mitch Duncan was brought on to fulfull all low frequency melodic duties. The band decided it was time to record their first (and so far only) EP, but not before bringing on a new member! Jackson Tuckwell became the fourth member of the band, taking on bass duties while Mitch became the bands lead guitarist and Erin took on rhythm guitar. The EP, "Johnnys House" was the second worst thing the band did since forming. The EP was so bad that Johnny left the band, being replaced by Kieran Van Acker of Mon Trez. Keep an eye on this site, we're always cooking up something...</p>
